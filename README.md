## Description
This boundary condition provides a jump condition, using the cyclicAMI condition as a base. The porous baffle introduces a pressure jump defined by:

&Delta; p = -(D &mu; U + 0.5 I &rho; |U|^2 )L

where

|       |               |
|-------|---------------|
|p -     | pressure [Pa] |
|&rho; -  | density [kg/m3] |
|&mu; -  | laminar viscosity [Pa s] |
|I -     | inertial coefficient |
|D -     | Darcy coefficient |
|L -     | porous media thickness in the flow direction [m] |


### Patch usage
```
|Property   | Description            | Required | Default value 
|-----------|------------------------|----------|---------------
|patchType  | should be cyclicAMI    | yes      | 
|D          | Darcy coefficient      | yes      | 0 
|I          | inertial coefficient   | yes      | 0 
|L          | porous media thickness | yes      | 0 
```

Example of the boundary condition specification:

```
myPatch
{
    type            porousBafflePressureAMI;
    patchType       cyclicAMI;
    jump            uniform 0;
    I               10000;
    D               0.001;
    L               0.1;
    value           uniform 0;
}
```
## Compilation
To compile, provide the path to Caelus site\_scons directory. E.g.

```
scons --site-dir="/home/user/Caelus/Caelus-8.04/site_scons" install
```

If successful, the library will be installed in `CAELUS_USER_LIBBIN`. E.g.

```
/home/user/Caelus/user-8.04/platforms/linux64g++DPOpt/lib
```

Finally, add the following to the `controlDict` to make the BC available to the solver.

```
libs ( "libporousBafflePressureAMIFvPatchField.so" );
```
